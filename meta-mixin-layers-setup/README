"Mixin" layer for adding layers-setup support into the Yocto Project LTS.

The layers-setup support was added to Mickledore, this thin special-purpose
mixin layer is meant to provide this functionality for Kirkstone by
backporting the appropriate files from openembedded-core.

To use this layer bitbake 2.0.12 / YP 4.0.12 or a later version is required,
or, alternatively, the following commit from bitbake:
