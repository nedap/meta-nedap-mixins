"Mixin" layer for adding layers-setup support into the Yocto Project LTS.

The layers-setup support was added to Mickledore, this thin special-purpose
mixin layer is meant to provide this functionality for Kirkstone by
backporting the appropriate files from openembedded-core.

In addition to this layer the following commit from bitbake is required:
